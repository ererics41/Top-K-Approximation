# Top-K-Approximation
The goal of the Top-K problem is to figure out the most popular/frequent elements of a set. A trivial solution is the keep a counter for each unique word encountered but this becomes difficult to do when the set becomes large. This project implements a heap and a hash table to approximate the top elements of a large set and uses the strategy of deleting the counter of the minimum word when our heap, which stores the frequencies of the most frequent words, is full. Additionally, a second heap that expands dynamically to store a counter of all words in order to get a true value is also implemented to compare how close our approximation is.
